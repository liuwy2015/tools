def: "OBSOLETE. Assists in the correct assembly of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits in vivo, but is not a component of the assembled ribosome when performing its normal biological function." [GOC:jl, PMID:12150913]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and a biological process rather than a molecular function. To update annotations, consider biological_process term 'ribosome biogenesis ; GO:0042254' or its children and molecular_function terms 'protein binding involved in protein folding ; GO:0044183' and 'unfolded protein binding ; GO:0051082'.

def: "OBSOLETE. A small disulfide-containing redox protein that serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. Interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism, based on the reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol." [GOC:kd]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents gene products. To update annotations, consider biological_process term 'protein thiol-disulfide exchange ; GO:0006467' and molecular_function term 'disulfide oxidoreductase activity ; GO:0015036' or its children.
